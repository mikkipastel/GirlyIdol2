### To the chosen one,
Our developers are working very hard to deliver the excellent product. So, we would like to find something to help them relax.  
Luckily, we found you, a super star developer who will come to create an application to save our team.
Are you wondering what it is ?  Well, it’s the simple app but powerful.   

#### You just need to :
1. Display grid of photos based on data from <a href="#api">API</a>.
2. When our developer clicks on each photo, it needs to show full screen image along with name and created date.
3. Please send us a `Pull Requests` when you're finished.

> ** Using 3rd party libraries are okay.

#### Bonus
1. Support both a portrait and a landscape screen. (The app should not call api again when rotating screen.)
2. With infinite scroll feature, our developers will be super happy.

### API
```
http://gank.avosapps.com/api/data/{keyword}/{limit}/{page}
```
> keyword  = Using this keyword '福利'<br />
> limit    = Limit number of items result.<br />
> page     = Pagination of results.<br />
